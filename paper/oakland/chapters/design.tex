We design a semantic-aware memory access profiler and
a semantic-aware address sanitizer.

\subsection{Languate Level Semantics}
To parse the semantics of each memory access is critical.

Currently, we define the following semantics: array access or struct access, pointer dereference.

\yphn{Inputs}

We exploit the source code.

\yphn{Outputs}
For a program, both profiler and sanitizer would generate their binaries.


\subsection{Semantic Analysis}
An important task is to collect the semantics of memory access.

\subsection{Memory object organization}
Do we need to use variable size red-zones for different kinds of objects?

\subsubsection{Heap Buffers}

\subsubsection{Stack buffers}

\subsubsection{Internal buffers}
An object sometimes contains a buffer inside itself.
This buffer may be security-sensitive if its adjacent members are function pointers.

For such an object, we create red-zones to surround the buffers, similar to what Asan does on stack buffers.

\subsection{Instrumentation}

Do we need to do another check after a loop?

\subsection{Exception Handling}
